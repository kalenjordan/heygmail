It's like Hey but for Gmail

Some of the features of hey.com that I love:
 - Screening functionality
 - Feed, Paper Trail, and Inbox as high level ways to think about email
 - Getting read of read/unread state
 
So I built a Gmail integration to basically wrap those features on top of Gmail.

1. Download this laravel site and install it
2. Configure your IMAP credentials in .env
3. Setup a minutely cron to run
